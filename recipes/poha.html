    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pohe is a light and flavorful Indian breakfast dish, primarily made from flattened rice (poha). Originating from Maharashtra, this dish is not only popular across India but also appreciated for its simplicity and versatility. The flattened rice is lightly sautéed with mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, and turmeric, giving the pohe its bright yellow hue. It is then combined with onions, peanuts, and other fresh ingredients like coriander and lemon juice for a burst of flavor. Pohe is a wholesome dish, quick to make, and often served with a side of tea or chutney.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Poha (flattened rice)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 green chili (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup peanuts</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>10-12 curry leaves</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon (cut into wedges)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the poha under running water for 10-15 seconds and let it sit in a strainer for 5 minutes to soften.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat oil on medium flame. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add curry leaves, green chili, and peanuts. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the peanuts are slightly roasted.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and cook until they become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in turmeric powder and salt, mixing everything well.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked poha and gently mix, ensuring the turmeric coats the poha evenly. Cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and squeeze fresh lemon juice over the poha.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped coriander and serve hot with additional lemon wedges.</li>
