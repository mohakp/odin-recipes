    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vada Pav, often referred to as the "Indian burger," is a popular street food from Mumbai, Maharashtra. It consists of a spicy potato fritter (vada) placed between soft bread buns (pav), slathered with flavorful chutneys like spicy green chutney and garlicky red chutney. The dish is served with fried green chilies and sometimes a side of crispy snacks. The combination of the crispy vada, soft pav, and tangy-spicy chutneys makes Vada Pav a perfect snack or a light meal, loved for its simplicity and bold flavors.</p>
